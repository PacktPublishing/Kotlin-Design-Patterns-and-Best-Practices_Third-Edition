## About the book

For developers who are working with design patterns in Kotlin, this practical guide offers an opportunity to put their knowledge into practice. The book covers classical and modern design patterns, and provides a hands-on approach to implementation, along with associated methodologies.

The third edition stays current with Kotlin updates, spanning from version 1.6 onwards, and offers in-depth insights into topics like structured concurrency and context receivers. The book starts by introducing essential Kotlin syntax and the significance of design patterns, covering classic Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns. It then progresses to explore functional programming, Reactive, and Concurrent patterns, including detailed discussions on coroutines and structured concurrency. As you navigate through these advanced concepts, you'll enhance your Kotlin coding skills. The book also delves into the latest architectural trends, focusing on microservices design patterns and aiding your decision-making process when choosing between architectures.

By the end of the book, you will have a solid grasp of these advanced concepts and be able to apply them in your own projects.
